    <p>I have always loved playingsports since I was very young. I always played soccer and at one point in high school was playing soccer, lacrosse and baseball...it was rough.</p>

    
    <p>I am very much into videogames and PC's. I enjoy playing videogames with my friends whenever I can. I have also been enjoying building PC's and tinkering with new equipment.</p>

        Career Goals
    </h2>
    <p> Right now as far as career goals I want to get through Devmountain and work in software engineering of some sort. I have a few connections around Utah who have offered me a place when I am done so I am excited to see where it takes me.</p>
    <p> I really just want a position that allows some flexibilty in work location and a level of financial stabilty.</p>
